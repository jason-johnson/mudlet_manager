# Mudlet Manager

This module is designed to provide a certain setup to almost any mud.  The concept is based around loadouts which must be defined per character.  These loadouts configure the buttons for the character using that loadout.  This aids muscle memory when switching between muds and characters as the buttons are always in the same place (assuming the user configures the loadouts similarly across all muds and characters)
